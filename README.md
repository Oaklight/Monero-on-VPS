# **Monero on VPS**
Mining Monero using clusters of cheap VPS (5 to 15 USD / yr or so) is an **experimental** project. </br>
Not all VPS suppliers agree with this, be careful with **High CPU Abusation.**

This project can ease your way to setup Miner or Miner-Proxy or both on either i686 or x86_64 platform VPS. </br>
The current version only support **cpu version** rigger. GPU version may not be considered since I don't have such ones.

****
## Current packages' versions:
-   XMRig 2.6.2
-   XMRig Proxy 2.6.0
-   Libuv 1.20.3

****
## Other information
**config.json** for xmrig and xmrig-proxy via [xmrig_config](https://config.xmrig.com/)

Default donation 0 for both xmrig and xmrig-proxy. :)

Scripts will be updated from time to time. If you have questions, feel free to kick off an issue.

****

## **Suggestions:**
1.  Activate **nicehash**, **keepalive**, maybe **fixed-diff** at proxy side, miner side should be adjust accordingly.
2.  wisely choose a pool with **port for low-end machine** (most cheap VPS are also poor equipped) if you only have very few number of cheap VPS;
3.  ``keep-it-run.sh'' spins to prevent xmrig from bad-connection-caused suspension.
